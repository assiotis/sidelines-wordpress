<h2>Description</h2>

Sidelines delivers free premium content that doubles time-on-site, boosts pageviews and grows revenue. 

Simply install the Sidelines plugin on your site and obtain a unique code on [Sidelines](http://sidelinesapp.com/publisher). Sidelines works automagically by parsing your content and understanding what your content is about, much like Google AdSense. Sidelines then matches your original content with a relevant discussion created by our community of fan experts. Not only that, but Sidelines will surface beautifully formatted related links *from your site*, increasing pageviews.
